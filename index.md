# Generalizable Predictions of ICU Readmissions & Deaths Using Machine Learning


## Overview



## Problem



## Datasets
### MIMIC-IV

### eICU

### Outcomes
  - 60-Day Readmission or In-Hospital Death
  - 48-Hour Readmission or In-Hospital Death (with observability requirement)

### Features
  - Latest value
  - Change over stay



## Modeling



## Results
Table 1: Results from training and predicting outcomes using the MIMIC-IV dataset on two different outcomes: (1) ICU readmission or in-hospital death within 60 days of ICU discharge, and (2) ICU readmission or in-hospital death within 48 hours of ICU discharge among patients remaining in the hospital (i.e. discharged from the ICU to the floor or other stepdown unit). 

| Model           |  Outcome 1: 60 Days (AUC) | Outcome 2: 48 Hours (AUC)|
| :--------------- | :---------------     | :---------------     |
| Logistic Regression | 67.8 | 84.0 |
| Decision Tree | 66.0 | 83.9 |
| XGBoost | 73.1 | 91.8 |
